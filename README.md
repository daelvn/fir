# Fir

Fir is a language-agnostic documentation generator framework. It is fully modular, which means you can mix a comment extractor with a different comment parser and emitter (but you aren't going to go through the hassle of writing anything). A set of generic modules for generating Markdown documentation is provided, don't expect much more (unless you press me to write more).

## Install

You can install Fir via LuaRocks:

```
$ luarocks install fir
```
